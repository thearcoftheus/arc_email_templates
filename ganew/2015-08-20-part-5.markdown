<td width="500" style="width: 500px;"><p>Hello, 
<br><br>
I joined The Arc Georgia as State Director just a few months ago, and have been on the road getting to know the great advocates at local chapters.  I want to express great appreciation for the warm reception and special invitations to events I’ve attended in the last three months, including: the Albany ARC Awards Banquet, Board meetings with The Arc of Grady Thomas and The Arc Carroll County, a training with The Arc Douglas County, The Arc of Greater Columbus’ involvement at the Georgia Winter Institute, and a lively dance at The Arc Carroll County. Soon I will be delivering a keynote address with The Arc Macon. I’m looking forward to many successful collaborations with the Georgia chapters of The Arc in the months to come. 
<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br><br>
