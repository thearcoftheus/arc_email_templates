NCE is proud to bring you the Disney Institute’s Approach to Leadership Excellence as this year’s NCE Professional Development Seminar in Orlando, FL. On the first half day, Disney will share its institutional expertise in:
<ul>
<li>Reconciling organizational tension</li>
<li>Intention vs. behaviors</li>
<li>The importance of teams</li>
<li>Measuring values against performance</li>
</ul>
On the second half day, we will put our new knowledge to use by forming action plans around case studies that relate to the topics above. The content from these case studies comes directly from your first hand experiences. This two-day event is truly not to be missed. <a href="http://convention.thearc.org/register/ ">Register today!</a>
