<br>Did you know women with I/DD had longer hospital stays, and were more likely to have Caesarean deliveries in contrast to other women? Rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes were elevated for women with I/DD across a range of measures, including early labor, preterm birth, and preeclampsia, and their infants were more likely to have low birth weight. Dr. Susan Parish will present findings from a study that compared deliveries among women with I/DD to the general obstetric population, and discuss the implications of these findings, as well as the targeted interventions needed to address these detrimental outcomes. <a href="https://www.thearc.org/page.redir?target=http%3a%2f%2fbit.ly%2f1R3G8Xx&srcid=37159&srctid=1&erid=7553538&trid=1d3c8c41-17b6-4d86-a3aa-408ab0965125">Register here</a>.
