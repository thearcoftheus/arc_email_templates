We have extended the deadline for NCE Distinguished Professional Awards to June 20, 2016.  Nominate someone you know today! Make sure your colleagues are recognized for the year-round hard work they do, and the advances they continue to make for people with I/DD. The Awards allow us the opportunity to spotlight programs and best practices, recognize our peers, and show off your chapter’s triumphs at the NCE Awards Luncheon during our National Convention in October. What are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.thearc.org/page.redir?target=http%3a%2f%2fthearcus.wufoo.com%2fforms%2fnce-distinguished-professional-awards%2f&srcid=38845&srctid=1&erid=8173040&trid=76922ed9-5de3-4fdb-8ada-0adb282d9c65">Nominating someone</a> couldn’t be easier.
