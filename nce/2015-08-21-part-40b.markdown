One of the first things Michele Ku, the President/CEO of The Arc of Kona, said to Steve McDonnell on a recent call was that when you are in Hawai’i “you can really feel cut off from everybody.” <a href="http://arcofkona.org/">The Arc of Kona</a> is located on the Big Island of Hawai’i and headquartered in Kealakekua. Prior to a recent visit to the Washington, DC area for a conference held by The National Coalition of State Rehabilitation Councils (NCSRC), Michele contacted The Arc to arrange for a visit to the national office. CEO Peter Berns and several other staff members met with Michele. Read more about her visit and the value of our chapter network <a href="http://www.thearc.org/file/KonaProfile.pdf">here</a>. Our local, state and national offices are united in our movement by our core values and mission. Peter welcomes all chapters of The Arc to visit the national office when they are in town and engage with staff. If you cannot make it to DC, Peter is more than willing to make arrangements to visit your chapter as well!
