Every year at National Convention, The NCE Silent Auction raises scholarship money to help send NCE members to professional training opportunities throughout the year. But first, we need things to auction! We are excited to announce that we have started off donations with a week's vacation to a popular destination of your choice through one of our generous donors who owns a timeshare. Help us bring in more wonderful items by contributing now. Please contact Carrie Hobbs Guiden at <a href="mailto:cguiden@thearctn.org">cguiden@thearctn.org</a> to donate.
