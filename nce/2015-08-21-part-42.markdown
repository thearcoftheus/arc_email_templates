At last summer’s NCE Summer Leadership Institute in Providence, RI, a forum titled “Town hall: Mapping the Future of Employment Services” was facilitated by Jonathan Lucus, Managing Director of The Arc@Work, and Cindy Thomas, Associate Director of the Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass-Boston. <a href="http://www.thinkwork.org/sites/thinkwork.org/files/files/RRTC_keyfindings6_F.PDF">The forum led to the creation of a brief</a>, co-authored by Amie Lulinski, Director of Research and Evaluation at The Arc, to share chapter experiences with transformation from sheltered workshops to community-based employment. In addition, emerging research findings from a Delphi process are shared. <a href="http://www.thinkwork.org/sites/thinkwork.org/files/files/RRTC_keyfindings6_F.PDF">Check it out!</a>
