Thank you to those who contributed an item to our Silent Auction campaign <i>Bigger! Better! More!</i> at this year’s Summer Leadership Institute. We have a couple of months before the NCE Silent Auction at The Arc’s Convention in Orlando, FL, so you still have a chance to contribute an item that will help send our chapter leaders and staff who have never attended SLI or the Professional Development Seminar to these events.  
<br><br>
Complete our online <a href="http://convention.thearc.org/sessions/nce-silent-auction/">form</a> to donate an item. If you have any questions, contact Laura Rahman, Director of Individual Philanthropy, at <a href="mailto:rahman@thearc.org">rahman@thearc.org</a>.
