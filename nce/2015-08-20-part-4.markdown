NCE is proud to bring you the Disney Institute’s Approach to Leadership Excellence as this year’s NCE Professional Development Seminar in Orlando, FL. On the first half day, Disney will share it expertise in leadership in the areas of:
<ul>
<li>Reconciling organizational tension</li>
<li>Intention vs. behaviors</li>
<li>The importance of teams</li>
<li>Measuring values against performance</li>
</ul>
On the second half day, we will put our new knowledge to use by forming action plans around case studies that relate to the topics above. This is where we need your help: we want the second half day to be meaningful and to address the challenges that you are facing in your daily work. If there is a specific challenge/issue you are facing, please send a brief synopsis of the situation to <a href="mailto:cguiden@thearctn.org">cguiden@thearctn.org</a> by close of business on Friday, July 8. Please also indicate which of the four topics above it best relates to. We will develop case studies based on the examples we receive. Thank you in advance for helping us making this year’s NCE Professional Development Seminar the best one yet!
