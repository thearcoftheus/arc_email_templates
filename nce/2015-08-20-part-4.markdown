Kick off your National Convention experience with the Professional Development Seminar at the Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista. Join your peers on October 28 — 29 as we examine issues encompassing leadership, organizational effectiveness, and the competencies and programming needed for a diverse I/DD community in the 21st century through the lens of “Disney’s Approach to Leadership Excellence.”

October 28: This half day program provided by the world renowned Disney Institute, will bring time-tested insights to how leadership and communication can be enhanced within our organizations.

October 29: The second half day will bring attendees together to strategize on using the Disney methods in their own organizations, and work with their peers to find solutions to common leadership challenges.
