NCE tasks groups are responsible for ensuring NCE continues to grow and provide opportunities for exchanging ideas, professional development training, and support and mentoring for successful leadership. Task groups are a great way to connect with fellow chapter staff and help strengthen The Arc. The task groups are: 
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Program Planning:</b> support program design and execution of SLI and Pre-Convention, including session topics and speakers.
<li><b>Membership Recruitment:</b> recruit chapters and get more staff involved in professional development activities.
<li><b>Membership Engagement:</b> identify activities to encourage NCE members to take advantage all that NCE offers, including The Arc Connection portal, SIGs, the Standards for Excellence program and SLI and Pre-Convention.
<li><b>Silent Auction @ Pre-Convention:</b> solicit auction donations and ensure the event goes smoothly.
<li><b>SLI and Pre-Convention Scholarship:</b> solicit applications from peers to attend SLI and Pre-Convention and select recipients.
<li><b>NCE Awards @ National Convention:</b> solicit submissions, select awardees, and ensure a successful function.
</ul>
