As your New England Regional NCE Rep, let me fill you in on our incredible July 18-20 NCE Summer Leadership Institute in Palm Springs, CA. This year’ event, titled <b>Community for All – Our Promise, Our Challenge</b> offered dynamic and inspiring ideas for community organizing, keeping one step ahead of sexual predators, shutting down sheltered workshops, housing solutions, planned giving and more!
<br><br> 
Networking also was a hit as our new attendees – a steadily growing number – continue to add to the energy of the conference. For R & R, a ride into the San Jacinto Mountains via the Palm Springs Aerial Tram followed by a farm-to-table dinner ensured a little time to talk shop and to relax. Our planning team from NCE certainly lined up a winning and dynamic program.
