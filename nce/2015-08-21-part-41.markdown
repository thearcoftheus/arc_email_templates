The Silent Auction page is now open for you to submit your items.  Your donation to the Silent Auction provides an invaluable opportunity for chapter leaders and staff who have not previously attended Summer Leadership Institute or Professional Development Seminar (formerly known as Pre-Convention) to come and meet with other chapter leaders while participating in meaningful professional development.  Please go here [hyperlink to Silent Auction page] to donate an item.
