The Arc has been awarded a $90,000 grant from the Amerigroup Foundation to conduct its Health and Fitness for All&trade; project at three chapters of The Arc in Texas and Tennessee. The Health and Fitness for All project utilizes the HealthMatters&trade; program, which is a training developed by the University of Illinois at Chicago that provides structured information on how to organize and start a tailored physical activity and health education program for people with I/DD.

With Amerigroup Foundation’s support, three of The Arc’s chapters that are certified in the HealthMatters program, <a href="http://www.arc-sa.org/">The Arc San Antonio</a>, <a href="http://www.aogh.org/">The Arc Greater Houston</a>, and <a href="https://www.thearctn.org/">The Arc Tennessee</a>, will implement the 12-week program to help increase participant’s knowledge about the importance of healthy eating and staying active.
