Amy Goodman, Director of The Arc's Autism Now Center, is now doing consulting work that involves public speaking. Public speaking is something that is difficult for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but in order to overcome her fear of people and being social she decided to try something new. Amy has taken her expertise from working on Autism Now and is offering speaking services to anyone who wants to hear from her about autism, ASD, bullying, employment, or anything else related to The Arc's Autism Now Center or <a href="http://www.thearc.org/thearcatwork">TheArc@Work</a>, our employment initiative here at The Arc.

Amy recently spoke at the 2015 Alabama <a href="http://www.aldisabilityconference.org/">disABILITY</a> conference in Orange Beach, Alabama. She believes she was a success because she was able to connect with her audience of individuals with disabilities by presenting from her own experiences.Â Learn more about <a href="http://blog.thearc.org/2015/11/06/autism-nows-new-service-public-speaking-engagements/">that experience</a>, and <a href="http://autismnow.org/on-the-job/bring-amy-to-you/">book Amy today</a>!
