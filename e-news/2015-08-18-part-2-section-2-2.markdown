<a href="http://blog.thearc.org/2016/04/18/will-ever-justice-jenna/">Jenna’s story</a> is one that is all too familiar—a sexual assault survivor with a disability still fighting for her day in court. In Jenna’s case justice may not have been served yet, but her story is a powerful reminder of the need for change in the system. As we mark Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we need to keep in mind why this topic is so significant to individuals with I/DD. 
<br><br>
Those outside of the disability community may be surprised to know that people with disabilities are raped or sexually assaulted at <b>four times</b> the rate of those without disabilities. Or that it is more common for people with I/DD to experience multiple victimizations throughout their lives. These facts highlight the need for individuals with I/DD to be fully included in all sexual assault awareness efforts year-round.
