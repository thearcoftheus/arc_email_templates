This year, we are excited to host the full cast of A&E’s hit docuseries Born This Way as our keynote speakers! <i><a href="http://www.aetv.com/shows/born-this-way">Born This Way</a></i> follows a group of seven young adults born with Down syndrome along with their family and friends in Southern California. Cameras follow the young men and women of Born This Way as they pursue their passions and lifelong dreams, explore friendships, romantic relationships and work, all while defying society’s expectations. Attendees will also have the opportunity to mingle with the cast and get autographs during a variety of events.
