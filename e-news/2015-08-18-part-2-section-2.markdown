As another year comes to an end, we are thinking about all of the courageous parents, brothers, sisters, friends and neighbors who came together to fight for the rights of people with I/DD every year.

<br>
Today, 75% of adults with I/DD live at home with their family. More than 900,000 of those families have caregivers who are age 60 or older. The clock is ticking for these families, and right now their future is uncertain. We face a silent crisis as families across the country worry about how their loved one with a disability will be cared for in the community when they are gone. 
<br><br>
The Arc has spent 65 years advocating for these individuals and their families, but we need your support to continue our work. Can we count on you to <a href="http://www.thearc.org/family">make your much needed year-end gift to help us move into the next 65 years?</a>
