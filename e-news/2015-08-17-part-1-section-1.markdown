On December 2, a mass shooting took place at Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California. The Inland Regional Center is a three-building complex that houses a conference center and serves more than 30,000 people with developmental disabilities. The Arc released a statement following the attack, and we continue to remain in contact with The Arc of California and other local chapters in the region. 
<br><br>
"Our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this tragedy, the people suffering injuries, and the families impacted by this senseless act. The Arc's collective heart is broken.
<br><br>
"The Inland Regional Center is one of thousands of service systems across the country for people with I/DD and their families. It's a place where people with disabilities, their families, caregivers, and dedicated staff gather to access services, learn how to navigate the service delivery system, and enjoy functions like the holiday party that took place the day before the shooting. It's not a place you would ever expect such violence.
<br><br>
"Today, and every day after, people with disabilities, parents, siblings, caregivers, and staff will walk into the Inland Regional Center. When will they feel safe again? They will live with this trauma, feel the pain like anyone else, and they must have access to services to support them to overcome it. Far too often in our society, the abilities of people with I/DD are underestimated. Appropriate supports must be available to them to process and heal after this tragedy, otherwise it will be an open wound. We owe all of those touched by this tragedy the dignity of healing," said Peter Berns, CEO of The Arc.
