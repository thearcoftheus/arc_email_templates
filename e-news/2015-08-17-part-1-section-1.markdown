#Autismis More than Just a Month!
True inclusion is much more than just awareness, it is acceptance. For over 65 years, The Arc has worked tirelessly through education, training, and advocacy to spread the message of inclusion. The Arcâ€™s Autism Now&reg; Center and the Wings for Autism&reg; programs are just two of our national initiatives working to accomplish this. The Arc also has <a href="http://www.thearc.org/what-we-do/programs-and-services">numerous other programs</a> paving the way to acceptance throughout the year, not just during April.

Follow the conversation and engage with us on social media using the hashtag #Autismis, and stay tuned throughout the rest of the month as we continue to share resources, information, and the stories of people with autism all over the country!
