Almost everything we buy in the grocery store is stamped with “best by” or “use by”, shouldn’t other parts of our lives have reminder dates on them? What about your stocks? How long have they been on your portfolio “shelf”? 
<br><br>
If your stocks have been hanging around your account’s “shelf” for a while, consider transferring them to The Arc before the end of the year. You will receive an income tax deduction that will help lower your 2016 tax bill. You won’t pay any capital gains on the transfer, and you will help us with a gift we can use equal to the full value of the stock. And, it might take something off of your end of year “to do” list.
<br><br>
We have simple transfer instructions available on <a href="https://www.thearc.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/donate-stock">our website</a> to help you make your stock gift, or call Laura Rahman directly at 202.534.3713. Thank you!
