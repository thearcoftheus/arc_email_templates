<a href="http://www.thearc.org/wingsforautism">Wings for Autism</a> has been expanding across the country since last year, and since national expansion began more than 500 families have benefited from this innovative program.

Anthony (Chenghao) Cheng, Lily Zhu, & Xinyi Xie reached out to friends and family to raise hundreds of dollars for Wings for Autism. We had a chance to catch up with them during our event at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia earlier this year to learn about what sparked their interest in the program. Their answers were inspiring! <a href="http://blog.thearc.org/2015/12/08/never-too-young-to-make-an-impact/">Read more on our blog</a>.
