The federal agency that leads national Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), has selected The Arc as a grantee to execute volunteer projects. The 2016 MLK Day of Service will take place on January 18 (or surrounding dates), and The Arc, through select chapters, will be involved in service events where people with I/DD will volunteer alongside people without disabilities. The events will be related to access to healthy food. In communities that have seen an increase in unemployment and childhood poverty, food security &mdash; specifically access to healthy food&mdash; is a large concern.
