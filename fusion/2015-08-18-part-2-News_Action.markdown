On 09/01/16, Daytona Beach Police officers were summoned to Florida Memorial Hospital after staff members located a woman who appeared to be lost. Officers found an African American woman who appeared to be in her late 20s or early 30s in the lobby. The woman appears to have several disabilities and is unable to communicate her name or where she resides. She is about 4 feet tall and weighs 140 lbs. and may answer to the name of “Jennifer”. The woman is in good physical health but officers are diligently attempting to reunite her with her family or caretaker. They believe she may be from another state. Anyone who knows the woman depicted above is asked to call Det. Runge at 386.671.5242 or <a href="mailto:runged@dbpd.us">runged@dbpd.us</a>.
