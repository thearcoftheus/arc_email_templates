The deadline for The Catalyst Awards nominations is <strong>June 24!</strong> The Awards aim to shine a national spotlight on individuals and organizations that are setting an example of what our communities will look like when the civil rights for people I/DD are fully realized. Last yearâ€™s inaugural awards were full of inspiration, celebration, and hope for a more inclusive future. We are very excited for the second year of the Catalyst Awards, but we need you to help us find those who are trailblazing for individuals with I/DD across the country. Visit the brand new <a href="http://catalystawards.org/">Catalyst Awards website</a> and <a href="http://catalystawards.org/">nominate a catalyst for change today!</a>
