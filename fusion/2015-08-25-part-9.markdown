The Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center announces its first annual Fellowship, and is accepting applications for the one-year 2017-2018 Fellowship. CREEC is civil rights non-profit that specializes in high impact litigation and advocacy fighting all forms of exclusion and discrimination in order to obtain effective and enduring systemic reforms that redeem the promise of fairness embodied in our nationâ€™s civil rights laws. The CREEC Fellowship is an opportunity for a recent law school graduate, law clerk, or returning lawyer to contribute creatively to the work of a small civil rights non-profit staffed by lawyers with decades of experience in civil rights advocacy and litigation in a broad range of areas including advocacy, litigation, public education and outreach, investigations, and brainstorming. <a href="http://creeclaw.org/fellowship/">Learn more here</a>.
