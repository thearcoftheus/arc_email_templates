Life after graduation can be a stressful time for individuals with I/DD and their families as the new graduate transitions into the workforce. The Institute on Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts-Boston is seeking individuals with I/DD and their families to participate in an online employment forum where members are discussing their experiences working through their family members’ transition into the workforce, including assessing the needs, abilities, and interests; navigating vocational rehabilitation; finding information; and, other supports in order to help others make this transition a little easier.
