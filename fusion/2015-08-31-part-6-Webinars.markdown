Many people with disabilities experience profound marginalization in multiple human rights domains, including disparities in sexual and reproductive health. This webinar will address the rights to sexual citizenship of people with disabilities and ways to advance sexual self-advocacy as a best-practice strategy to facilitate empowerment among people with disabilities. Findings from an exploratory study that examined how people with intellectual and developmental disabilities define and experience the concept of sexual self-advocacy will be discussed. <a href="http://www.bit.ly/1Smnc3y">Register here</a>.
