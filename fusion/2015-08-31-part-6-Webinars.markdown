With several state ABLE programs preparing to begin enrollment, the ABLE National Resource Center (ANRC) would like to invite potential ABLE participants, their families, and all other ABLE stakeholders, to attend a free webinar focused on helping you understand how to determine which ABLE program might be best for you and how to best prepare to open your ABLE account. In addition to our presenter and moderator, Michael Morris, the webinar will also feature the perspectives of a diverse group of guest panelists comprised of both potential ABLE beneficiaries and family members. <a href="http://bit.ly/1TEHmWF">Register here.</a>
