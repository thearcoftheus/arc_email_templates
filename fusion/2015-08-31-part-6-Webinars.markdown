Mental health courts were created to divert offenders from prison into long-term community based treatment. These courts rely on assessments, treatment plans, and ongoing behavior monitoring to address both the mental health needs of offenders, as well as safety needs of the community. But, are they appropriate for people with I/DD? NCCJD will discuss the results of a recent survey of mental health courts serving people with I/DD. A historical perspective of mental health courts will be provided, and their role and purpose in the criminal justice system defined. We will discuss how the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Court specifically addresses the needs of individuals with I/DD and the benefits of serving them. Negatives of mental health courts and whether they are adequate to serve those with I/DD will also be addressed. <a href="http://bit.ly/21kWFcs">Register here.</a>
