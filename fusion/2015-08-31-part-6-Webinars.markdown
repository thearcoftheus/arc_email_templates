Provider agencies across the country are transitioning from segregated “sheltered” workshop options to supporting integrated community careers for people with disabilities. This process of organizational transformation can be both exciting and challenging. In this webinar, researcher Jaimie Timmons from the Institute for Community Inclusion will share findings from her project, the RRTC on Advancing Employment for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. Wally Tablit will co-present. Wally is a leader in the field of supported employment, with over 18 years of experience working with people with disabilities. <a href="https://umb-ici.adobeconnect.com/rrtc44jan2017/event/event_info.html">Register here</a>.
