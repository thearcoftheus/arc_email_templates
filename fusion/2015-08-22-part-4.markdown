Through The Arc’s partnership with Comcast NBCUniversal, chapters across the country are hosting “Learning Labs” to foster digital literacy skills in their constituents. The classes’ content varies between chapters based on individual needs. The Arc of Prince George’s County in Maryland was recently featured by Comcast for their work! Congratulations to the chapter on their hard work, successful labs, and exceeding their yearly placement goal in only the first four months!
