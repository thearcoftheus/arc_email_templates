<a href="http://convention.thearc.org/sessions/nce-silent-auction/">Donating an item to our Silent Auction</a> will help raise scholarship money so other professionals in The Arc’s network can attend Summer Leadership and Professional Development Seminar and develop their skills. And, it’s easy! Don’t wait. We need your help to make this year’s Silent Auction Bigger, Better, More! Your donations last year gave <strong>eight</strong> professionals the opportunity to develop their skills at this year’s SLI. <a href="http://convention.thearc.org/sessions/nce-silent-auction/">Donate today!</a> Please contact Thuba Nguyen at <a href="mailto:tnguyen@thearc.org">tnguyen@thearc.org</a> if you have questions.
