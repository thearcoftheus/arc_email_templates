In 2016, The Arc launched a new initiative, <a href="http://thearcatschool.org">The Arc@School</a>, to build the capacity of The Arcâ€™s nationwide network of chapters to support students with I/DD and their families in developing and implementing individualized education programs (IEPs) that will help students with I/DD graduate from high school and pursue post-secondary education and employment. The newly-launched website aims to be an online resource for students with disabilities, their parents, and advocates that includes information, best practices, and a resource directory, where you can find links and contact information for chapters of The Arc, protection and advocacy programs, parent centers, and state education agencies in your state. <a href="https://blog.thearc.org/2017/02/01/navigating-school-arcschool-launches-website-help-students-disabilities-parents-special-education-advocacy/
