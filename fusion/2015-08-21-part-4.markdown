The Arc’s Silent Auction raises funds to send chapter leaders and staff to Summer Leadership Institute and NCE’s Professional Development Seminar (formerly known as Pre-Convention) for a professional development. Help your fellow colleagues by donating. Items that have been donated include:
<ul>   
<li>Two Indy 500 tickets to the racing capital of the world</li>
<li>A bottle of Jack Daniels engraved with The Arc name, date and location of the national convention—purchased and engraved on-site at Jack Daniel’s distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee.</li>
</ul>
Don’t wait. We need your help to make this year’s Silent Auction Bigger, Better, More! Reach out to your community businesses—anyone can donate, and anyone can bid!
