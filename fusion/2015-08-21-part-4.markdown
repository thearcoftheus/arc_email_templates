The Arc’s Center for Future Planning™ is committed to supporting families and individuals with I/DD to plan for the future. The Center is working to provide chapters of The Arc with information and resources to support (existing and new) program efforts around future planning and family support. The Center recently launched Build Your Plan™, an online tool that enables families to create accounts and begin to build their plans. Check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/23mqARV9">demonstration webinar</a> to learn more about how to navigate Build Your Plan and encourage families to begin creating plans!
