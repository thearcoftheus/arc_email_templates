Did you know The Arc has a corporate font? Our primary font is ITC Stone Sans Medium. This should always be the default font used if you’re a branded chapter! If you don’t have access to ITC Stone Sans (we can help you), please use Trebuchet is the alternative. Happy typing! Questions? Contact The Arc’s Brand Coordinator, <a href="mailto:glaze@thearc.org">Bethany Glaze</a>. We’re always happy to help!
