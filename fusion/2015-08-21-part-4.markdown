Social Security Inspector General Patrick P. O'Carroll is warning citizens to be aware of phone calls from unknown people who claim to have information about a citizen's application for disability benefits and offer assistance with the citizen's claim. The Office of the Inspector General received a report from a Maryland citizen who recently received several of these phone calls, even though the citizen had not applied for disability benefits. The callers appear to be "phishing" for personal information--such as Social Security numbers or personal financial information&mdash;from unknowing citizens, who possibly have applied for disability benefits and thus might be inclined to provide information to the caller in furtherance of his or her claim. <a href="https://oig.ssa.gov/newsroom/news-releases/march29-advisory">See the full advisory at the OIG website.</a>
