Since 2011, The Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AIDD) has been funding Partnership in Employment Systems Change grants to improve competitive employment at the state level for youth and young adults with I/DD. There is a current opportunity for six new state-based groups to apply (AK, CA, IA, MS, MI, NY, TN, and WI are NOT eligible this round). Chapters of The Arc have a vital role to play in these efforts! Please see the full application package for details, including required and optional partners: <a href="http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=employment">http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=employment</a>. Applications are due July 26th. Please feel free to contact Casey Nitsch at <a href="mailto:Nitsch@thearc.org">Nitsch@thearc.org</a> with any questions.
