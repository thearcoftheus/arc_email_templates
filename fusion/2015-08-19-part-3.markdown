In 2012, one in five voters with disabilities experienced a barrier at the polls. To help resolve problems in real-time, The Arc is launching our new Voter Support Service (vote.thearc.org)! Working with Election Protection’s national support network, we are aiming to make it easier for people to report problems and get help as quickly as possible. This site is a simple, mobile-friendly way for people with disabilities to ensure that their vote counts. We need your help! This is a critical election; every vote counts! Check out vote.thearc.org  and spread the word in your chapter and community. Before Election Day, we hope to have an app-store version ready to launch. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:mckiernan@thearc.org">Kristen McKiernan</a>, Senior Executive Officer, Communications at 202.534.3712, or <a href="mailto:rafi@thearc.org">Abe Rafi</a>, Director, Digital and Online Services, 202.534.3729.
