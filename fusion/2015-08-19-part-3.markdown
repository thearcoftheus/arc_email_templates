There are many people in our chapters who make the impossible possible—tell us who they are! This year at the annual NCE Distinguished Professional Awards, we will celebrate staff across the country who strive for excellence and fulfill The Arc’s core values. We have even added new awards: Exemplary Career Leadership, Diversity and Cultural Competency Achievement, Program Innovation, and Exemplary Mentor. And, we have the Lifetime Achievement in the I/DD Field Award (for non-NCE members)! Think you know someone who deserves a pat on the back? <a href="http://thearcus.wufoo.com/forms/nce-distinguished-professional-awards/">Nominate them today!</a> Nominations (and self-nominations) are open until May 15, 2016. Contact Ilyse Kramer by <a href="mailto:Kramer@thearc.org">email</a> or at 202.534.3707 with questions.
