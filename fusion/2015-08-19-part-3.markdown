We need you to reach out to your Senators and Representatives to let them know why the ACA and Medicaid are essential to people with disabilities and their families!
<ul>
<li>Attend Town Hall Meetings. Check out this great new resource listing all scheduled town hall meetings across the country. If your Senator(s) or Representative has any scheduled next week, please attend and bring your staff, volunteers, friends, and family. Here are questions to ask your Members of Congress about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid. Bring signs and wear orange to get noticed.</li>
<li>Share our Latest Action Alert with Your Networks. Take Action to Prevent Gutting of The ACA and Medicaid includes separate fact sheets and talking points. Please share widely since Congress may vote on an ACA repeal measure as soon as the week after the President’s Day recess!</li>
</ul>

In the last few weeks, chapters have employed <a href="http://www.thearc.org/what-we-do/public-policy">The Arc’s messaging toolkit</a> on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid and getting coverage in their local media. We encourage you to follow their lead! The Arc New Jersey placed a <a href="http://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/01/15/letter-obamacare-lifeline-idd/96559020/">letter to the editor</a> on the importance of the Affordable Care Act to people with disabilities that ran in 5 local news outlets. The Arc Wisconsin <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/changes-to-wisconsin-s-medicaid-program-could-be-wide-reaching/article_28cf3292-377e-5f02-9e5a-05c318233607.html">chimed in</a> on how changing the structure of Medicaid would hurt people with I/DD. The Arc of East Central Iowa has placed two op-eds in a local paper in the last few weeks, one on <a href="http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnists/how-obamacare-helps-people-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-20170118">the ACA</a> and one on <a href="http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnists/changes-coming-to-medicaid-from-washington-20161230">Medicaid</a>. The Arc of Harrisonburg and Rockingham in Virginia <a href="http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Disabled-Americans-among-millions-that-may-lose-healthcare-under-APA-repeal-411000555.html">responded</a> on why the ACA is important to people with I/DD. And The Arc of Greater Pittsburgh/ACHIEVA was <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2017/01/30/Advocates-concerned-about-proposals-to-block-grant-Medicaid/stories/201701300002">quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> on the impact of block granting Medicaid. We encourage you to use <a href="http://www.thearc.org/what-we-do/public-policy">The Arc’s Lifeline toolkit</a> to create media or respond to media inquiries on the ACA, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, and more.
