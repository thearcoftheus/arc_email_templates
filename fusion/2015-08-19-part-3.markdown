Robert (Bob) Perske was a great friend of The Arc and all those we serve. He was beloved in the disability community. While Bob served as a Chaplin at an institution for people with I/DD, became an Executive Director for a chapter of The Arc, and authored ground-breaking books on creating circles of support for people with disabilities; the passion that he carried through the end of his life was his advocacy to support and educate people with I/DD coerced into giving false confessions and facing the death penalty. Bob’s family and leaders of The Arc want to make sure that his legacy doesn’t end with his passing, and created the Robert Perske Fund for Criminal Justice and Disability to keep Bob’s spirit alive. <a href="https://www.thearc.org/perskefund">Help us by making a gift today</a>, and promote this fund so his work on behalf of people with disabilities caught up in the criminal justice system can and will go on.
