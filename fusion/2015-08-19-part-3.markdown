Join us in Palm Springs, California from July 18 – 20 for this year’s Summer Leadership Institute: <strong>Community for All—Our Promise, Our Challenge</strong>. This year, we will have skill-building workshops where interactive, hands-on techniques will be used to enhance your understanding. There will also be more and longer unstructured networking opportunities to share experiences and learn from others in your shoes. And, kick back at our two evening events: a relaxed group dinner at Matchbox, and a tramway ride with a breath taking view of the desert below, concluding with dinner in a scenic state park. <a href="nce-sli.org">Register today, early bird pricing ends May 31!</a>
