Join us at the 2016 <a href="http://convention.thearc.org/sessions/nce-pre-convention-leadership-institute/">NCE Professional Development Seminar</a> before convention in October! What do our leaders need to successfully meet the needs of a diverse I/DD community? Answer this question and more as you network with your peers and learn best practices. NCE is partnering with the world-famous Disney Institute to deliver a program specifically designed to leverage time-tested business insights from the Disney organization. It is an opportunity to reflect on how to think differently about leadership to better support and motivate our teams. <a href="https://app.certain.com/profile/form/index.cfm?PKformID=0x2343917b019">Register for the 2016 National Convention & International Forum</a> today!
