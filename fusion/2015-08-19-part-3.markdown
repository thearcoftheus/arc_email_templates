In November 2016, The Arc submitted an amicus brief with a large coalition of other disability and civil rights advocacy organizations, in support of the petitioner in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District RE-1 before the U.S. Supreme Court. This case addressed the following question: what is the level of educational benefit that school districts must confer on children with disabilities to provide them with the free appropriate public education guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act? The brief argues that Congress’s move to standards based education, combined with the specific language of the amendments to the IDEA, make the Tenth Circuit’s merely-more-than-de-minimis standard untenable. These amendments make clear that a school district’s educational interventions must provide a child with a disability an equal opportunity to meet the standards the district applies to all children. Any deviation from that universal standard must be tied to the unique needs of the child. <a href="http://www.thearc.org/file/public-policy-document/11-21-16_Filed-Brief.pdf">The full brief can be found here</a>.
