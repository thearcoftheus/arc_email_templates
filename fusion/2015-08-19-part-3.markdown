The deadline to submit Catalyst nominations is June 24. Help us spark the movement! Last year’s inaugural <a href="http://www.catalystawards.org">Catalyst Awards</a> were an invigorating event that not only inspired our audience but moved them to action. We continue to hear how last year’s event was a highlight of convention for many. <a href="https://www.conferenceabstracts.com/cfp2/login.asp?EventKey=OKNRNCEZ">Help us find this year’s Catalyst!</a> We need nominees that are innovative advocates helping to create an inclusive society for individuals with I/DD. There are individuals and organizations doing amazing things across the country. We need you—our network—to bring to light those that are trailblazing to help fulfill The Arc’s mission. <a href="http://www.catalystawards.org">For inspiration, check out last year’s award winners.</a> Questions?
