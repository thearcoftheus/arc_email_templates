The federal <a href="http://www.lifelinesupport.org/ls/">Lifeline Program</a> has provided a discount on phone service for low-income consumers for many years. Now, Lifeline has expanded to provide discounted broadband internet service—a welcome benefit that will help some of the more than 60 million people without a connection to the internet. Changes are also occurring in verifying eligibility for Lifeline that service providers and other advocates should know about.
Lifeline provides a discount of $9.25 per month to eligible low-income subscribers. Consumers are eligible if they are enrolled in any of a number of programs including Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Federal Public Housing Assistance and/or are low income (at or below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines). <a href="http://www.lifelinesupport.org/ls/">Learn more here</a>.
