Whenever you attend events or send items to someone, make sure your giveaway or token has your logo and website on it. More exposure to your brand means more people will remember it! For example, check out these cookies that <a href="http://www.thearcnlc.org/">The Arc of New London County</a> sent us here at the national office! (And they were yummy!) Great job guys! Questions?  Contact The Arc’s Brand Coordinator, <a href="mailto:Glaze@thearc.org">Bethany Glaze</a>.  We’re always happy to help!
