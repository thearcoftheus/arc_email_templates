Researchers at Catholic University of America (CUA) are seeking first or second generation parents of Middle-Eastern descent who are living in the US, raising a child aged 2 â€“ 17 with autism/a developmental disability, and are proficient in English to participate in research exploring the experiences of caregivers raising children with developmental disabilities. Individuals can participate by completing an <a href="https://bit.ly/ArabCaregiverExperience">online questionnaire</a> (30-40 minutes). Participants who complete an optional phone interview can enter a lottery to receive a $50 gift card. This study is in partial fulfillment of requirements for a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at CUA.
