Creating a future plan—a guide for a person to lead a good life as independently as possible—is important for all people with I/DD. Please join us for a panel discussion on strategies that people with dual diagnoses of I/DD and mental health needs and their family members can use to create future plans that build on the individual’s strengths, likes, and dislikes. Join our panelists as we identify challenges in planning for people with dual diagnoses and explore how to identify and implement strategies to provide the greatest opportunity for independence and growth for each individual, as well as ways to support people through the grief and loss that comes with transitions. <a href="https://thearc.webex.com/mw3100/mywebex/default.do?service=7&main_url=%2Ftc3100%2Ftrainingcenter%2Fdefault.do%3Fsiteurl%3Dthearc%26main_url%3D%252Ftc3100%252Fe.do%253FAT%253DMI%2526%2526Host%253DQUhTSwAAAALEBkyLNvXNhkxnawGj-ufQDdIg6RIsPnZwY6k8AuUAYY7b4drI76E87byDUrDlMonz4uACaYe2asl0nYmw5zkc0%2526UID%253D0%2526MTID%253Dt80de6ad1b6226c4e148d3d31b050b677%2526siteurl%253Dthearc%2526confID%253D3574853047%2526ticket%253D4832534b00000002f03c01d9308af90f7c17599304e01b9505bf4996274024362ae1beb68efefc02&siteurl=thearc">Register here.</a>
