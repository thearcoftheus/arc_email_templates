<p>One in five Americans — over 54 million — have a disability, yet many public health programs do not include them in their program design. People with disabilities are more likely to experience chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease as compared to people without disabilities. There is a clear need for public health efforts to reduce these health disparities. The Including People with Disabilities: Public Health Workforce Competencies were created for the public health workforce to provide basic knowledge on the relationship between disability and public health programs, and increase the capacity of public health practitioners to include people with disabilities in their public health efforts. This presentation will provide an overview of the Competencies and examples for implementation, as well as how the material has been adapted to educate public health professionals about how to include adults with ID in planning and health promotion.</p>
