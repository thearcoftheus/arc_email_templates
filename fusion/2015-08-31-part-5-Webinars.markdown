<p>The majority of adults with I/DD live at home with their families, and this is particularly true for adults with I/DD from diverse backgrounds. Some research suggests that adults with I/DD who live in the community face many health challenges compared to those in residential settings. In this webinar Dr. Magaña will present research on health outcomes of African American and Latino parental caregivers, and on racial and ethnic disparities on health outcomes among adults with I/DD. She will discuss policy and community based interventions to address these disparities with a focus on how agencies serving IDD can address the health of families of persons with I/DD. <a href="http://bit.ly/2bSnaa8">Register here</a>.
