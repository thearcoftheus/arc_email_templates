Today, we kick-off the annual NCE Summer Leadership Institute. We have an exciting program planned and will be exploring important topics such as alternatives to traditional day services, diversity and cultural competence, person centered planning, community organizing for impact, and more. You can follow the event online using the hashtag #SLI2016. If you were not able to make it this year, my message for you is <b><i>Meet me in St. Louis!</i></b>
