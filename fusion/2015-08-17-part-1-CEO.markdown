Last summer, participants described NCE Summer Leadership Institute as “the best yet,” and this year we plan to exceed even those lofty sentiments. We hope to see you in Palm Springs, July 18 – 20, 2016; you don’t want to miss it. We will be taking on big topics, such as Alternatives to Traditional Day Services, and learning how social media and grassroots organizing can translate into big wins for people with I/DD and their families. We will explore the role of person-centered planning in systems transformation, and delve more deeply into practical applications of person centered practices for different programs and services. You will hear directly from the business community about their views on disability hiring, and have the chance to consider the role of chapters of The Arc in implementation of ABLE accounts. And there is so much more! Register or learn more <a href="http://www.nce-sli.org/">here</a>. As always, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.</p>
