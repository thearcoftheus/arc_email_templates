On behalf of The Arc family — board and staff here at the national office — we would like to wish you our best for a happy and healthy holiday season and a wonderful New Year. We hope that each of you has an opportunity to get some rest and recharge over the next couple weeks. We have a lot of work to do in 2017.   

We will need to hit the ground running, educating the new Congress and Administration about the needs, interests and concerns of people with I/DD and their families. So, please, find the telephone numbers and email addresses of your elected representatives. And be prepared to share your personal story! As always, you can reach me at <a href="mailtoberns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.
