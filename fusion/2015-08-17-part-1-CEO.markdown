You’ve probably heard about the catastrophic flooding that hit North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Matthew. These disasters appear to be happening with increasing frequency and, once again, people with I/DD served by several chapters of The Arc, the chapters themselves, and their employees have been impacted. The Arc of Stanly County/Monarch reports that staff are working valiantly to support the people they serve, while grappling with their own losses. The Arc North Carolina reports that a number of other chapters and individuals have been affected.

Here are a couple options for how you can help.
The Arc of Stanly County/Monarch has set up a <a href="https://www.monarchnc.org/donate/ways-to-give/make-a-donation-online">special fund</a> to provide short-term assistance to the people they support and staff members whose lives have been significantly impacted by Hurricane Matthew and its aftermath. 

The Arc of North Carolina also has established a fund to collect donations and provide support to individuals with I/DD, their family members, and chapters that have been impacted. You may send your donation to them at 343 E Six Forks Rd., Ste 320, Raleigh NC  27609 or call them at 919.782.4632.   

Lastly, you may send a donation to <a href="https://www.thearc.org/donate?erid=8447167&trid=ac97db59-b7f8-4bc2-87ed-f49ec1f50c31">The Arc’s disaster relief fund</a>, which you can find in the 'Designation' drop down, and we will invite applications and process donations to impacted chapters.  As always, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.
