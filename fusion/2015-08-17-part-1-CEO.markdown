<p>Are you taking advantage of The Arc’s Vehicle Donation Program? I just finished our 2015 Year End Review and learned that last year 200 state and local chapters of The Arc participated in the vehicle donation program. More than half, 135 chapters, received at least one donation. A total of 607 cars were donated, yielding $249,000 to our chapters.</p>
 
<p>If you haven’t signed up, you can find more information <a href="http://www.thearc.org/for-chapters/chapter-resources/car-donation">here.</a>  As always, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.</p>
