One of the goal’s in the Strategic Framework for the Future of The Arc, 2010-2019, is to build The Arc to be an even more powerful advocate for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The strategies for advancing this goal call for increasing awareness and participation in The Arc in communities of color, including people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  

In furtherance of these objectives, The Arc empaneled a Committee on Diversity which studied issues of diversity and cultural competence at all levels of The Arc and then developed and recommended to the Board of Directors a Diversity Strategic Action Plan. We appreciate the many chapters which provided input into the development of the plan and are pleased to be able to share it with you. As you will see, the plans speaks to achieving greater diversity and cultural competence at the national level, while also providing resources and supports for chapters to do so at the state and local level as well.     

Please take a few minutes to read the plan by visiting the <a href="http://www.thearc.org/who-we-are/diversity-at-the-arc">new section of our website</a>, and stay tuned for more information and resources. In the meantime, I would love to hear what you think about the Diversity Strategic Action Plan; email me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.
