It’s 27 days until 2017. As I work on our budget, program, and staffing plan for 2017, I’m thinking a lot about what we can do next year that will make a difference for your chapter of The Arc and the people you serve. We gather your input all year long and just received a lot of valuable feedback and ideas at the listening sessions and business meeting at the National Convention. But it’s not too late. So please email me at <a href="mailtoberns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a> with your suggestions for what should be The Arc’s New Year’s resolutions in 2017.
