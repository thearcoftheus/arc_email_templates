Lately, it seems that everyone is asking about alternatives to traditional day services. But what are they? As states begin to change their services systems based on the <a href="http://bit.ly/1Q1zVvw">HCBS settings rule</a>, we are even more challenged to think about how to support people with the most intensive support needs to be more engaged in their communities.  

We would love to hear from you about innovative and financially sustainable program models you have developed, or are exploring, to support people with I/DD to have a personally satisfying way to spend their day. Please email me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a> to share what you are doing and what you are learning. Thanks.
