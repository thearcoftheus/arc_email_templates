Would you like the chance to help better the lives of those with I/DD through technology?
The Arc is offering sub grants to chapters for Comcast Learning Labs to bring technology into the lives of individuals with I/DD. We are seeking chapters to host recurring Learning Lab events. Chapters are not required to be in Comcast’s service area in order to apply. These events should focus on the use of technology to help individuals with I/DD. The structure of a Learning Lab may vary based on the selected chapters and their resources. However, the intention is to showcase the use of technology and the positive impact it can have on the lives of individuals with I/DD. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBlZx28f0weKxw1u2HaGc91TefHojw3EMUeZtta2p2o/edit?pref=2&pli=1">Take advantage of this opportunity and apply today!</a>
