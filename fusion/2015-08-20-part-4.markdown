We are only a few weeks away from the deadline to complete the crucial FINDS Survey! Please help support our data-driven advocacy by completing this survey and sharing it with your networks. We are inviting family or unrelated caregivers aged 18 years or older, who provide frequent primary support to a person with an I/DD to participate. The results of the 2010 Survey provided unique insight into the growing gaps in education, employment, and other life-span activities that exist between persons with disabilities and their non-disabled peers, which has informed further dialogue and policy changes at the Federal and State levels. <a href=“http://www.thearc.org/page.redir?target=https%3a%2f%2fwww.thearc.org%2fpage.redir%3ftarget%3dhttp%3a%2f%2fthearc.org%2fFINDS%26srcid%3d42060%26srctid%3d1%26erid%3d8903948%26trid%3d735391c7-9b86-4afd-8511-18735cce4f34&srcid=42354&srctid=1&erid=8965340&trid=84cdfe11-b3b8-49aa-9fc0-4c8ee2c37f70”>Take the survey and share it widely in your networks</a>!
