The Suskind family, our friends and keynote speakers at two of our last three national conventions, will be the subject of an hour-long special on ABC's 20/20 on Friday, November 25th at 10pm ET. The special chronicles the family's 20-year journey with their son, Owen, who has autism, as told in Ron's book and the award-winning documentary Life, Animated. Ron and Cornelia, in conjunction with leading clinicians, helped change the way autism's powerful self-directed passions—what the Suskind's call affinities—can be turned into pathways for social/emotional connection and growth. Using these insights, the family recently worked with leading neuroscientists and technologists to develop Sidekicks, a new kind of communications platform that allows parents and professionals to connect with kids on the spectrum by harnessing these self-directed interests. The app, available for free on <a href="http://sidekicks.com/">sidekicks.com</a>, is now being researched at Harvard to map its efficacy in language growth and emotional regulation.
