Another successful National Convention (and International Forum)! We hope everyone who attended enjoyed the sessions, speakers, and meeting new people from across the world—we know we did! If you weren’t able to make it, you can check out some teaser pictures in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thearcus/photos/?tab=album&album_id=10155538933557715">our Facebook album</a> and stay tuned for a lot more in the coming weeks! You can see what attendees had to say by searching the hashtag #ShapetheFuture on Twitter and Facebook. We hope you’ll join us next year in San Diego from November 1 – 4, 2017. Save the date!
