A new groundbreaking bill aimed at convicting criminals who commit sexual assault and other violent crimes against people with developmental disabilities has been signed! Assemblywoman Shannon Grove introduced and carried the bill at the chapter’s request. Working with her, they got unanimous votes in both the Assembly and Senate, and now Governor Brown has signed it into law. Under the new law, when there’s a case of a crime against a person with I/DD, the judge will be required to make reasonable efforts to schedule the trial at a time the doesn’t conflict with another trial for the same prosecutor. This will help district attorneys assign trained, experienced prosecutors to these often complex and difficult cases.
