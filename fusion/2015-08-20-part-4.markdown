The Arc is offering sub grants to chapters to host recurring Comcast Learning Labs which will run from July 2016-December 2016.  Chapters are not required to be in Comcast’s service area in order to apply. These events should focus on the use of technology to help individuals with I/DD, with the intention of showcasing its positive impact. The structure of a Learning Lab may vary based on the selected chapters and their resources. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBlZx28f0weKxw1u2HaGc91TefHojw3EMUeZtta2p2o/edit?pref=2&pli=1">Take advantage of this opportunity and apply before May 20th!</a>
