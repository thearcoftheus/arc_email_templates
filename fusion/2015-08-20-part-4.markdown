Join us in the happiest place on Earth for our 2016 National Convention & International Forum, in partnership with Inclusion International! <a href="http://convention.thearc.org">Don’t wait—take advantage of the early bird price while it lasts!</a> Our theme, “Shaping the Future”, will explore how we can collaboratively impact the I/DD community globally. This year, we are excited to host the full cast of A&E’s hit docuseries Born This Way as our keynote speakers. Attendees will have the opportunity to mingle with the cast and get autographs at a variety of events. But there’s much more! <a href="http://convention.thearc.org">Check out the convention site</a> to explore the schedule of events and all there is to do in Disney!
