Did you know The Arc has an image library on our “For Chapters” section for you to use? They include pictures of our constituents as well as high-quality stock photos that we’ve purchased. And they’re FREE for your use! Just pick which ones you like and download them. If you need an even higher resolution version, just ask. And, feel free to send us any pictures you’re proud of! We’re always looking for great pictures to use in our national products, and eager to show off our superstar chapter activities! Questions? Contact The Arc’s Marketing Associate for Graphic Design and Branding, <a href="mailto:glaze@thearc.org">Bethany Glaze</a>. We’re always happy to help!
