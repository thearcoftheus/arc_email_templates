<p>A great resource for your website and print products are photographs of your chapter members. When you’re photographing events and people, make sure you take the extra second to focus the camera so it’s not blurry! It’s also great to click first and review later – the more you take, the more you have to choose from when you look afterwards! And—don’t forget we have a whole free library of stock photos and more at your fingertips, which you can access under ‘Marketing’ in the ‘For Chapters’ section of our site. Questions?
