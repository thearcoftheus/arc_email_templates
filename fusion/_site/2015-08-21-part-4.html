<p>In September 2016, The Arc submitted an amicus brief before the Supreme Court of Michigan in support of the appellee, a mother with intellectual disability, requesting that the court deny leave to appeal where the Court of Appeals correctly found that the state failed in its statutory duty to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family unit because the case service plan never included reasonable accommodations to provide her with a meaningful opportunity to benefit as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. <a href="http://www.thearc.org/file/Hicks-Brown-Motion-for-leave-to-file-Amicus-brief.pdf">The full brief can be found here</a>.</p>
