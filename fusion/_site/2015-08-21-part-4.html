<p>Comcast NBCUniversal has invited chapters of The Arc to get involved and become local partners on their special corporate day of giving. Comcast Cares Day brings their employees, their friends, and families together with their nonprofit partners to make change happen in local communities from coast to coast, and abroad. Comcast NBCUniversal has planning underway for Comcast Cares Day, which takes place on April 22, 2017. This is a great opportunity to foster a relationship with Comcast NBCUniversal at the local level, and build on our relationship as a national partner. During Comcast Cares Day, volunteers from Comcast NBCUniversal work within your community to help make impactful improvements. This could be with schools, agencies, parks, or your chapter! Projects may vary across chapters. If you are interested in working with Comcast NBCUniversal to collaborate on a Comcast Cares Day, please contact <a href="mailto:Lernihan@thearc.org">Katy Lernihan Schmid</a>. Decisions on sites will be made before the end of January!</p>
