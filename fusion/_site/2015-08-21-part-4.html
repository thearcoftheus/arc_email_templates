<p>The Arc recently filed two amicus briefs on the rights of students with disabilities under the IDEA in Endrew F. v. Douglas (before the U.S. Supreme Court) and, with The Arc Connecticut, CCJEF v. Rell (before the Connecticut Supreme Court). <a href="http://bit.ly/2jIf3Az">Both briefs can be found here</a>. Recently, attorneys from The Arc attended oral arguments before the Supreme Court of the United States in the Endrew case. <a href="http://nyti.ms/2iXsrzx">The New York Times covered the arguments</a>.</p>
