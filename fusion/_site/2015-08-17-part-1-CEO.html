<p>We are looking for some “early adopters.”  Would your chapter like to work in collaboration with the national office to develop, market, and deliver services to Fortune 1000 companies? Collectively, The Arc has tremendous expertise that is needed in corporate America, and they are willing to pay for our services. We will be starting with employment and helping federal contractors to meet their new obligations under the 503 regulations to employ people with disabilities.</p>

<p>We will also be using the Specialisterne model to help companies find individuals on the autism spectrum to work in technology jobs. We will also offer our The Arc’s to assist employers in reverse logistics, retail, manufacturing, warehousing, hotel and hospitality, healthcare, and many other industry sectors to realize the benefit of employing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  And we expect to provide disability awareness and related training to companies on the ground floor. This is your chance to get involved on the ground floor! Email me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a> if you are interested and we will get back to you with more information about the collaboration.</p>
