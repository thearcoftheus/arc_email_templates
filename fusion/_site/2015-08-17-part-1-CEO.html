<p>Do you know a nonprofit in your state that would be a good fit to become a chapter of The Arc? Currently, The Arc has 657 chapters in 48 states and DC, but there could be more. There are 14 states that have 3 or fewer local chapters, including 8 states where there is no state chapter at all.</p>
