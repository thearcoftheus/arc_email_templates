<p>It’s a New Year.  Watch your mailbox – physical, not electronic – for the annual letter I send every year commenting on the year past and the road ahead. It will arrive along with your chapter’s 2017 affiliate dues invoice, and we thank you in advance for your chapter’s support.</p>

<p>Along, with the cover letter and invoice you will find a one-page statement of The Arc’s “strategic objectives” for the year, which should give you a sense of what we will be focusing on during the year. Please share the cover letter and strategic objectives with your board and key staff, as its chock full of information. And don’t hesitate to let me know what you think via email at <a href="mailtoberns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.</p>
