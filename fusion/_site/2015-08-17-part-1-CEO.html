On Sunday, January 22, an EF3 tornado tore through Albany, Georgia, taking lives and decimating the landscape. The local chapter of The Arc, Albany Advocacy Resource Center (Albany ARC), sustained tremendous damage at one of its group residences when the storm sent towering Georgia pines crashing through the home’s roof and on top of staff vehicles. Thankfully, all individuals had already been relocated to safe surroundings before the tornado hit, but they will be displaced for some time. As Albany ARC looks to rebuild while continuing to care and advocate for the 800 individuals with disabilities and their loved ones they serve across South Georgia, any and all support from chapters is appreciated. Donations made be made via <a href="http://albanyarc.org/">Albany ARC’s website</a> or sent to Albany ARC, 2616 Pointe North Boulevard, Albany, GA 31721. As always, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a>.</h1>
