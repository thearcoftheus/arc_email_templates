<p>In Search of Bicyclists
We are looking to identify individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who like to ride bicycles, including any who may be serious cyclists. We would also like to identify any chapters of The Arc that conduct a fundraising or other type of event that involves bicycling. Why, you may ask?</p>

<p>The reason is that we recently met with some folks that did a <a href="http://www.pursuitride.org">coast to coast bike ride last summer</a> “to advance the interests of people with disabilities across the country.” They met with several chapters of The Arc along the way and paid us a visit here in DC as well. They are thinking about what to do next, which led us to think about whether there are cyclists among us and perhaps an opportunity here. So please email me at <a href="mailto:berns@thearc.org">berns@thearc.org</a> with any information or thoughts you care to share!</p>
