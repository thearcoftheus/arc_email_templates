<p>In addition to the quarterly publication of the State Advocacy Matters newsletter, we have <a href="http://www.stateadvocacymatters.org/">launched a blog</a> to post more regular updates on the advocacy work our state chapters are engaging in. The blog posts are tagged by category, subcategory, state, and date, making them easily searchable for a variety of purposes. You can sign up to receive email updates whenever there is a new post on the blog. State chapters, we want to hear from you! Please make sure to share your updates with <a href="mailto:Wakschlag@thearc.org">Shira Wakschlag</a> on an ongoing basis.</p>
