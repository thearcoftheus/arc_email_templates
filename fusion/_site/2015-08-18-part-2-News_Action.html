<p>Registration is open for the 2017 Summer Leadership Institute, taking place July 24-26 in St. Louis! Join us to engage in meaningful discussions with fellow chapter staff and develop skills you can replicate, tailor, and apply directly back in your local communities. Learn from over 40 nationally-recognized speakers and choose from 28 topical breakout sessions. Hear from The Arc’s staff around the country, who are tackling the same challenges and situations in their own chapters. The best teacher is experience, and your peers have tons to share with you! &lt;a href=“http://nce-sli.org”&gt;Register today&lt;/a&gt;!</p>
