<p>In 2012, one in five voters with disabilities experienced a barrier at the polls. To help resolve problems in real-time this year, The Arc has launched a <a href="https://vote.thearc.org">new Voter Support Service</a>! Working with Election Protectionâ€™s national support network, we are aiming to make it easier for people to report problems and get help as quickly as possible. This site is a simple, mobile-friendly way for people with disabilities to ensure that their opinion is heard. The service is also available in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voter-support-service/id1168078931?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vote.thearc.app">Google Play</a>. We need your help! This is a critical election; every vote counts! Check out vote.thearc.org and spread the word in your chapter and community. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:mckiernan@thearc.org">Kristen McKiernan</a>, Senior Executive Officer, Communications at 202.534.3712, or <a href="mailto:rafi@thearc.org">Abe Rafi</a>, Director, Digital and Online Services, 202.534.3729.</p>
