<p><a href="http://disabilitypolicyseminar.org">Registration is officially open for 2017 Disability Policy Seminar</a>! We hope you are renewed and ready to rally to ensure that our lifeline programs and civil rights are protected. Join us in the nation’s capital from March 20 – 22, as passionate advocates, self-advocates, experts, and professionals in the field convene in the heart of Downtown DC to learn about key issues, network, and speak directly to representatives. The first 100 days of any new Administration and Congress are key to setting the agenda—and this year, more than ever, we need you in Washington, DC to advocate for the lifeline programs. The Disability Policy Seminar is your chance to make an impact. <a href="http://disabilitypolicyseminar.org/register">Register today</a>!</p>
