<p>Last week, 19 people were killed during a vicious attack on a residential care facility in Sagamihara, Japan. We join with our friends and colleagues at Inclusion International and Inclusion Japan to mourn the loss of those who were taken from this world too soon and wish those who are injured a full recovery. To show the families of the victims that we mourn their loss and that the lives of people with I/DD matter, <a href="http://inclusion-international.org/japan-attack/">Inclusion International</a> is inviting people to share messages of condolences either on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/inclusioninternational/">Facebook page</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/InclusionIntl">Twitter.</a> They will collect and share these messages with Inclusion Japan and the families of the victims.   </p>
