Join us at this year’s crucial Disability Policy Seminar to get informed, connected, and ready to protect the things that matter most. Access to our bedrock federal programs and civil rights protections are at risk—Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, Supplemental Security Income, and Social Security are threatened. These federal programs provide the key to community living and inclusion for people with I/DD across the nation.  Any cuts would be devastating. We MUST be diligent, informed, and ready to act. We need you there with us—<a href="http://disabilitypolicyseminar.org">register today</a>!</p>
