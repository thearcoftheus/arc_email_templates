<p>Through a grant from the Verizon Foundation two chapters of The Arc, <a href="http://www.arcmacon.org/">The Arc Macon</a> and <a href="http://www.thearcgloucester.org/">The Arc Gloucester</a>, have been utilizing a VGo robotic device to provide telehealth care and health education to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities within their community. Chapters have placed the VGo in various day and residential programs to allow their chapter nurses to closely monitor and address new and chronic health concerns. Through this technology chapter nurses were able to provide more frequent and timely care to help improve health outcomes of the individuals they serve. VGo will be making an appearance at The Arcâ€™s National Convention in Orlando, so be on the lookout for it to learn more about this exciting project!</p>
