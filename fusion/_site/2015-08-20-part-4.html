<p><a href="http://www.thearc.org/who-we-are/history/name-change">The Arc’s name has had some major evolutionary changes over the years</a>, which is why it’s so important to display it correctly. “Arc” as a standalone returns us to the days of it being an acronym and the association with the “R” word. If we all use “The Arc” consistenly in all references to our name, and think of it as a title or a phrase (as in over The Arc of a lifetime) we will give our name meaning and it will be easier for our name to gain awareness and resonance.</p>

<p>*Note – this is especially important that your name includes the “The” in all Twitter handles, Facebook names, and all other references—both print and digital. Including the word is also part of branding guidelines included in your chapter’s licensing agreement! Questions? Contact Pam Katz (<a href="katz@thearc.org">katz@thearc.org</a>).
