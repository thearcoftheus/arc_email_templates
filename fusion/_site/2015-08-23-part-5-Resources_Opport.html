<p>We are only a few weeks away from the deadline to complete the crucial FINDS Survey! Please help support our data-driven advocacy by completing this survey and sharing it with your networks. We are inviting family or unrelated caregivers aged 18 years or older, who provide frequent primary support to a person with an I/DD to participate. The results of the 2010 Survey provided unique insight into the growing gaps in education, employment, and other life-span activities that exist between persons with disabilities and their non-disabled peers, which has informed further dialogue and policy changes at the Federal and State levels. <a href="https://www.thearc.org/page.redir?target=http%3a%2f%2fthearc.org%2fFINDS&amp;srcid=42060&amp;srctid=1&amp;erid=8903948&amp;trid=735391c7-9b86-4afd-8511-18735cce4f34">Take the survey and share it widely in your networks</a>! If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:Lulinski@thearc.org">Amie Lulinski</a>. Deadline: April 30.</p>
