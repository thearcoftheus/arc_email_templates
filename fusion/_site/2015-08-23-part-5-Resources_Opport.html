<p>With the new year comes a new <a href="http://www.thearc.org/FINDS">Family and Individual Needs for Disability Supports (FINDS) Survey</a>. We need your input and dissemination help! The Research and Training Center on Community Living at the University of Minnesota in collaboration with The Arc, is seeking survey caregivers to share their perceptions on a range of life-span issues impacting individuals with I/DD. We are inviting people aged 18 years or older who provide frequent primary support to a person with an I/DD to participate. Stay tuned this upcoming month for its release.</p>
