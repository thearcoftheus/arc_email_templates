<p>Join NCCJD for our next webinar as we delve into the topic of policing people with disabilities, with a focus on people of color and women with disabilities. This webinar will be the first in our 2017 Policing People with Disabilities series that educates law enforcement, other criminal justice professionals, people with disabilities, family members, and disability advocates about the various intersections that play into discrimination and violence toward people with I/DD within the criminal justice system and how we can address the issue by examining innovative programs and potential solutions from around the country. <a href="http://bit.ly/2gJ7YyO">Register here</a>.</p>
