<p>Fear that bad things could happen to people with I/DD can create a barrier that stops families from planning for full and independent lives in the community.  Building skills that promote safety can help families overcome this barrier and move forward to create a robust future plan. Speakers Theresa Fears and Leigh Ann Davis will provide strategies that help people with I/DD develop the skills to understand and fully participate in healthy relationships. The speakers will also describe how to build skills to recognize when a relationship is unhealthy, exploitative, or abusive and provide concrete steps to take in those situations. <a hef="https://thearc.webex.com/thearc/k2/j.php?MTID=t2bc7783c9e0b50d190cb7a960144ddc5">Register here</a>.</p>
