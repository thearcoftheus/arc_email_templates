<p>The Sibling Leadership Network (SLN) is a national nonprofit dedicated to providing support and information to siblings of people with disabilities across the lifespan. Currently there are 22 state chapters of the SLN with the vision to have a chapter in every state in the country. Chapters are the grassroots of the organization and where personal contact with siblings happens. Each chapter has its own feel and flavor. If you are interested in starting a chapter in a state that does not currently have one, please join this webinar to learn the process for creating and developing a sibling chapter of the SLN.</p>

<p>As a project partner for the Family Support Research and Training Center (FSRTC), the SLN has developed A Guide for Sibling Chapters. This webinar will provide foundational information on how to start a sibling chapter in your state. <a href="http://bit.ly/2k7KMM4">Register for this session here</a>.</p>
