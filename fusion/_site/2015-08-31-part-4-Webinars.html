<p>The Sibling Leadership Network (SLN) is a national nonprofit dedicated to providing support and information to siblings of people with disabilities across the lifespan. Currently there are 22 state chapters of the SLN with the vision to have a chapter in every state in the country. Chapters are the grassroots of the organization and where personal contact with siblings happens. Each chapter has its own feel and flavor. If you are interested in starting a chapter in a state that does not currently have one, please join this webinar to learn the process for creating and developing a sibling chapter of the SLN.</p>

<p>As a project partner for the Family Support Research and Training Center (FSRTC), the SLN has developed A Guide for Sibling Chapters. This webinar will provide foundational information on how to start a sibling chapter in your state. <a href="http://bit.ly/2k7KMM4">Register for this session here</a>.</p>

Health provider organizations across the country are greatly impacted by changes in health care delivery, policy changes, and payment reform. Some organizations who have thrived in the past are struggling with these changes to the point some of them are failing while other organizations are using this as an opportunity to flourish. Today’s business environment calls for shifts in clinical practices, business acumen, and management approaches. Successful organizations also tend to have a well-functioning Board of Directors who is working collaboratively with upper management. This webinar will address changes in the health delivery business environment and how they are impacting the boardroom. Specific topics include the challenges of board membership, effectiveness and involvement, plus recommendations for upper management to engage their boards while still maintaining separate roles for management and boards. <a href="http://go.reliaslearning.com/WBN2017-02-21MeetingtheChallengeofOrganizationalChange_RegistrationPage.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTURVNU0yTTBZekptWm1RNCIsInQiOiJJMFU3OHorUHAxckZWVGIwdTU5eHlrTWlMZXpvVHhxWit2aDVmemFKbkVCTlJLRmVnc0haREFVUlwvRmZxNjdLYUZTejVQZERcL1JUS1R4VFRUajk2bGNwVGNHdXNPWHRuanc4dVNtcXdKUEhCREdIWlwvMTV3M0htK2Y5WTd3TWhyYiJ9">Register here</a>.
