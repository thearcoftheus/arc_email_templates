<p>The transformation from segregated work settings can bring liberation and empowerment. But the process of change is not always easy or comfortable for individuals with I/DD and their families.
A variety of issues can come up for people with I/DD as the agencies that serve them switch to integrated employment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cessation of weekly paychecks when their workshop shuts down.</li>
<li>They might stop seeing their friends on a daily basis once the workshop closes.</li>
<li>They may get a part-time job, leaving the rest of the day needing to be filled.</li>
<li>Their family may feel the pressure of helping their relative find and keep fulfilling work in the community.</li>
</ol>
