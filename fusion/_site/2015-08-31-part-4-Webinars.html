<p>While end-of-life issues are increasingly gaining more attention, people with I/DD continue to receive significantly less consideration in research, education, and clinical practice compared with the general population. This is a growing concern, with the number of persons aging with I/DD expected to double by 2030. As policies continue shifting to reflect a preference for home and community-based services as an alternative to institutionalization, adult day services (ADS) have the potential of becoming ideal settings for receipt of end-of-life care for individuals with I/DD. However, end-of-life care and advance planning most commonly occur in long-term care settings, for the general population, and have historically been less of a priority in ADS and residential services for people with I/DD. This presentation discusses findings from a study around the attitudes of, and collaboration between, ADS and end-of-life providers for aging adults including persons with I/DD. We will also explore how ADS may be a great pathway for delivering end-of-life care to the I/DD population and provide guiding recommendations. Presenters: <a href="mailto:corina@uic.edu">Corina R.
