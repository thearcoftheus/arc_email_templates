Please visit our Tech Survey Challenge website (tech.thearc.org) and submit a survey about technology that is being used by individuals with I/DD at your chapter! 
Each survey takes less than 10 minutes and the information we are collecting will help inform The Arc about technology that is being used by people with I/DD and their support needs. We are accepting submissions indefinitely! Please reach out to &lt;a href=“mailto:Lernihan@thearc.org”&gt;
