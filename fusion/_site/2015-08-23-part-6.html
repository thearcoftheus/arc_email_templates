<p>The Arc@School is pleased to <a href="https://www.thearc.org/file/the-arcschool/Chapter-Pilot-RFP.pdf?erid=8959505">announce the creation of a special education advocacy training curriculum</a> specifically for chapters of The Arc to help prepare chapter staff to advocate on behalf of students with I/DD and their families in special education matters. The training curriculum will discuss how the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 apply to individual students, as well as advocacy strategies to address potential concerns at each step of the special education process and ensure that students receive a “free and appropriate public education.” The Arc@School will award $2,000 grants to 10 chapters that are currently providing individual special education advocacy services to help develop and pilot the training curriculum by December 2017. Apply directly via email to <a href="mailto:ullman@thearc.org">Shawn Ullman</a>, Director, The Arc@School. Applications due: Friday, March 24 at 11:59 pm ET.</p>
