<p>Don’t miss the chance to participate in this year’s Entrepreneur Alley at our 2016 National Convention &amp; International Forum! Every year, this Convention favorite draws talented self-advocates with diverse skills from around the country who have built small businesses, as well as those employed in a business run by their local chapter of The Arc. The experience is a valuable and profitable opportunity to network with attendees from around the world, including the cast of Born this Way which will be participating this year! This is the final opportunity to be included in the Convention program book. <a href="http://convention.thearc.org/sessions/entrepreneur-alley/?erid=8294100&amp;trid=ee036af2-68b8-4b49-8c9d-9e90b0d32ba2">Sign up today to be a part of Entrepreneur Alley</a>.
