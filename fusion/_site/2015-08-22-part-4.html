<p>The Arc’s tagline “Achieve with Us” means different things to everyone. Does achievement mean being employed? Having your own house? Equal rights? You tell us! 
We want to hear what achievement means to you and your supporters. Your story may be nationally showcased in our national end of year campaign.  If you’d like to share a short story or even a few words, please send them to <a href="mailto:rahman@thearc.org">Laura Rahman</a>.</p>
