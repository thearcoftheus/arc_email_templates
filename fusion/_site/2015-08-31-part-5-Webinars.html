<p>Join state chapter executive directors Jon Meyers, Tony Anderson, and Stella Beard to learn about their efforts to improve support to families by creating statewide coalitions of organizations advocating for people with disabilities, seniors, and caregivers. In 2016, The Arc of Arizona and The Arc of California convened organizations to identify challenges in their state family support system and develop an action plan to address them. The Arc of Kentucky reconvened the coalition it created in 2015 to review accomplishments and challenges and plan for the year ahead. These coalitions were created through the Family Support Research and Training Center (FSRTC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The FSRTC explores supports needed by families of people with disabilities and seniors and promising practices in family support around the country. <a href="https://thearc.webex.com/thearc/k2/j.php?MTID=tb0d81bf848eb6e80acb30143123452e5">Register here</a>.</p>
