<p>Diversity has long been viewed as a way for organizations to leverage talent to meet organizational objectives. The Arc’s 2016-2020 Diversity Strategic Action Plan focuses our efforts to become an even more powerful advocate for people with I/DD. By increasing awareness and participation by The Arc in diverse communities and attracting people of all ethnic and cultural backgrounds, The Arc’s seeks to achieve greater diversity and cultural competence at the national level, while also providing resources and supports for chapters at the state and local level. Join us as Dawn Cooper, Manager of Diversity and Cultural Competency at The Arc, talks about the plan and how to position your diversity initiative for success and achieve your organizational mission and vision. <a href="http://bit.ly/2dxO05w">Register here</a>.</p>
