In the last few weeks, chapters have employed <a href="http://www.thearc.org/what-we-do/public-policy">The Arc’s messaging toolkit</a> on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid and getting coverage in their local media. We encourage you to follow their lead! The Arc New Jersey placed a <a href="http://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/01/15/letter-obamacare-lifeline-idd/96559020/">letter to the editor</a> on the importance of the Affordable Care Act to people with disabilities that ran in 5 local news outlets. The Arc Wisconsin <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/changes-to-wisconsin-s-medicaid-program-could-be-wide-reaching/article_28cf3292-377e-5f02-9e5a-05c318233607.html">chimed in</a> on how changing the structure of Medicaid would hurt people with I/DD. The Arc of East Central Iowa has placed two op-eds in a local paper in the last few weeks, one on <a href="http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnists/how-obamacare-helps-people-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-20170118">the ACA</a> and one on <a href="http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/guest-columnists/changes-coming-to-medicaid-from-washington-20161230">Medicaid</a>. The Arc of Harrisonburg and Rockingham in Virginia <a href="http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Disabled-Americans-among-millions-that-may-lose-healthcare-under-APA-repeal-411000555.html">responded</a> on why the ACA is important to people with I/DD. And The Arc of Greater Pittsburgh/ACHIEVA was <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2017/01/30/Advocates-concerned-about-proposals-to-block-grant-Medicaid/stories/201701300002">quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> on the impact of block granting Medicaid. We encourage you to use <a href="http://www.thearc.org/what-we-do/public-policy">The Arc’s Lifeline toolkit</a> to create media or respond to media inquiries on the ACA, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, and more.

<p>We need your input and help disseminating this crucial survey! The Research and Training Center on Community Living at the University of Minnesota in collaboration with The Arc, is seeking survey caregivers to share their perceptions on a range of life-span issues impacting individuals with I/DD. We are inviting people aged 18 years or older who provide frequent primary support to a person with an I/DD to participate.</p>
<p>The results of the 2010 Survey provided unique insight into the growing gaps in education, employment, and other life-span activities that exist between persons with disabilities and their non-disabled peers, which has informed further dialogue and policy changes at the Federal and State levels.</p>
<p><a href="http://thearc.org/FINDS">Take the survey and share it widely in your networks</a>! <strong>The deadline is March 30.</strong></p>
