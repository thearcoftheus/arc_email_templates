<p>People with disabilities disproportionately live in poverty, and 80% have no emergency fund to turn to in a time of crisis. People with disabilities, like all consumers, have the right to fair treatment in the financial marketplace and access to tools that can help them improve their financial lives. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is seeking approximately 30 organizations that serve people with disabilities and are interested in helping build the financial capability of the people they serve. Selected organizations will receive training, guides, toolkits, and other resources.</p>
