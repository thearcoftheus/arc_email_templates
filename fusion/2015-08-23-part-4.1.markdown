Some of the awards they have received recently are: Non-Profit of the Year Award from the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce; Public Service Innovator of the Year Award from the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce; Carroll V. Shreve Award for Meritorious Human Service from the Falls Church Chamber of Commerce; Innovation Award from the Washington Business Journal; and a Technology Innovation Award from 501cTECH.
