Thanks to the generous support of the Amerigroup Foundation, three chapters of <a href="http://www.arc-sa.org/">The Arc—The Arc of San Antonio</a>, <a href="http://www.aogh.org/">The Arc of Greater Houston</a>, and <a href="https://www.thearctn.org/">The Arc of Tennessee</a> —are now implementing the Health and Fitness for All program.
