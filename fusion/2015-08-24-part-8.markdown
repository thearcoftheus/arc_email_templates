Register now for The National Academy of Social Insurance 2017 conference on Jan. 25-26 in Washington DC! The conference will be the beginning of a year-long initiative to brief the new leadership on the economic security challenges facing the American people and opportunities to address these through social insurance. These opportunities will include both strengthening and/or modernizing existing programs – Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, Medicare and Medicaid, and Unemployment Insurance – and addressing significant risks not currently covered by our social insurance infrastructure – caregiving, long-term care and contingent work. <a href="http://bit.ly/2iaoi8C">Register here</a>.
