The Arc is seeking stories to add to a report making recommendations on disability employment policy for The Century Foundation. We are seeking stories that include but are not limited to the following issues related to people with disabilities in the workforce:
<ul>
<li>Have you lost your job and faced discrimination in hiring?</li>
<li>Do you feel that you fell through the cracks when you aged out of IDEA services?</li>
<li>Have you had success with competitive, integrated employment?</li>
<li>Do you receive SSI and work but are having difficulty taking advantage of the work-incentive programs allowing you to retain Medicaid?</li>
</ul>
Please send any stories to <a href="mailto:murphy@TheArc.org">Katherine Murphy</a> by <b>August 26</b>.
