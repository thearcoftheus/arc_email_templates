Join NCCJD as we help attorneys, clients, and their families understand each other’s needs and obligations during a criminal case, and how they can work together to ensure the best representation possible for people with I/DD. Mr. Gordo will speak about his son, Paul, who has autism and was charged with assault after experiencing sensory overload at a library. Hear how the Gordo family was able to work with their defense attorney to get the charges reduced from a major felony to a misdemeanor. Ms. Kelley will discuss the ethics of representing someone with I/DD and the perspective of the attorney in cases where the client has I/DD. Ashley Brompton will discuss how the worlds of clients/families and attorneys can come together and help each other. <a href="http://bit.ly/26X2H87">Register here.</a>
