Health provider organizations across the country are greatly impacted by changes in health care delivery, policy changes, and payment reform. Some organizations who have thrived in the past are struggling with these changes to the point some of them are failing while other organizations are using this as an opportunity to flourish. Todayâ€™s business environment calls for shifts in clinical practices, business acumen, and management approaches. Successful organizations also tend to have a well-functioning Board of Directors who is working collaboratively with upper management. This webinar will address changes in the health delivery business environment and how they are impacting the boardroom. Specific topics include the challenges of board membership, effectiveness and involvement, plus recommendations for upper management to engage their boards while still maintaining separate roles for management and boards. <a href="http://go.reliaslearning.com/WBN2017-02-21MeetingtheChallengeofOrganizationalChange_RegistrationPage.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTURVNU0yTTBZekptWm1RNCIsInQiOiJJMFU3OHorUHAxckZWVGIwdTU5eHlrTWlMZXpvVHhxWit2aDVmemFKbkVCTlJLRmVnc0haREFVUlwvRmZxNjdLYUZTejVQZERcL1JUS1R4VFRUajk2bGNwVGNHdXNPWHRuanc4dVNtcXdKUEhCREdIWlwvMTV3M0htK2Y5WTd3TWhyYiJ9">Register here</a>.
