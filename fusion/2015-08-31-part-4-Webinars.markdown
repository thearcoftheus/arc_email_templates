The majority of children and adults with I/DD live with their families. This is especially true for people with I/DD from Latino and other minority households. The primary caregivers in these households, who are usually mothers, face significant challenges with their own emotional and physical health. Furthermore, research suggests that lifelong caregiving exacerbates already existing health disparities that Latina women face. Effective practical interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and well-being among caregiving mothers are needed. 

In this webinar, Sandy Magaña, Miguel Morales, and Judith Rocha will present information about an evidenced-based intervention, “By Caring for Myself, I Can Care Better for My Family.” This intervention engages community health workers who are also family caregivers of persons with I/DD to deliver the curriculum. They will discuss cultural aspects and other components of the intervention, how to set up a similar project in your area, and how to adapt it to other cultural groups. <a href="https://thearc.webex.com/thearc/k2/j.php?MTID=tfd01e7894afacc85ccd21134e03fea50">Register here</a>.
