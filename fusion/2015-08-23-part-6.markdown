Do you know a person with a disability who has voted in the past? What was the experience like? This election season, The Arc is looking for people with I/DD willing to share personal accounts of their experience voting.  Their blog could describe an amazing experience, one that he or she would rather forget, or somewhere in between.  The chapter or the person with I/DD should email us one or two paragraphs that shares their story, and we will be in touch if we would like to publish their story as a guest blog on thearc.org, or in one of our publications. Submissions can be sent to <a href="mailto:woodard@thearc.org">Taylor Woodard</a>.
