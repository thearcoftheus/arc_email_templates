The Griswold Cares Foundation provides grants with the aim of building, strengthening, and sustaining programs that enhance the quality of life for low-income seniors and adults with disabilities who have chosen to age in place. One-year grants of up to $2,000 will be awarded in support of programs that provide respite care and short-term home care. The foundation also will consider funding for local community and grassroots organizations that provide other programs and services with the intent of helping those of limited financial means to age in place. Higher amounts may be awarded when a program is an exceptional fit with the foundationâ€™s mission or giving priorities. <a href="http://www.griswoldcares.org/Priorities.html">Apply today</a>!
