The Center for Future Planning is seeking additional chapter leaders to join our Future Planning Chapter Workgroup. The workgroup meets four times a year (via teleconference) and provides guidance to the staff in the national office to help us (1) Develop future planning materials that chapters can use to support families in their communities (2) Guide the development of practical web tools for families and people with I/DD relating to future planning, (3) Provide webinars and other training to chapter staff to build expertise within The Arc on topics related to future planning;  and (4) Set priorities for the Center and advise us on how best to engage chapters of The Arc in the work of the Center.
