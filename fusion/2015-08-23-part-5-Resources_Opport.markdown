Next year, we will have a new President and many new Members of Congress. Already, President-Elect Trump and some Congressional leaders have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as soon as possible in 2017, and news reports suggest that deep cuts may be on the table for Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and other lifelines for people with I/DD. The outcomes of the upcoming battles will be determined by the strength of our advocacy! Get ready by learning more about the lifelines of the <a href="http://www.thearc.org/document.doc?id=5647">ACA</a>, <a href="http://www.thearc.org/document.doc?id=5609">Medicaid</a>, and <a href="http://www.thearc.org/document.doc?id=5654">SSI</a>.

The first 100 days of any new Administration and Congress are key to setting the agenda – and this year more than ever, we will need advocates to step up to protect the lifeline programs from potential threats.
