Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is a genetic condition that affects about 50,000 people in the U.S., 50% of whom have an intellectual disability or other cognitive and developmental issues. TSA is currently hosting several walks around the country, in the following locations: Hilton Head Island SC; Houston TX; Clark NJ; Miami FL; Allison Park (Western) PA; Las Vegas NV; Cleveland OH; Fremont CA; and Nashville, TN.  
This is a wonderful opportunity for your chapters to engage new members with TSC and their families and build local partnerships. Tables at each event will be offered to chapters of The Arc FREE OF CHARGE. See a full list of walk dates, locations, and local contact information here. (direct download of excel sheet attached) For general information about TSA, please contact Dena Hook at <a href="mailto:dhook@tsalliance.org">dhook@tsalliance.org</a>.
