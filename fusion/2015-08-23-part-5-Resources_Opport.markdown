Are you attending this yearâ€™s Summer Leadership Institute?  Join us to learn about the simplest way to raise funds with the highest return on investment, Planned Giving!  A robust Planned Giving program has the potential to provide your Chapter with a foundation for stability so that you can be there for your constituents now and in the future.  Lunch includes a speaker from Wealth Engine and it is open for all members of the current chapter Work Group (35 chapters and growing) and those who are curious and interested in learning and becoming a member.
Please contact <a href="mailto:henke@thearc.org"Jen Henke</a> to get more information about how your chapter can benefit from planned giving and becoming part of the Work Group.
