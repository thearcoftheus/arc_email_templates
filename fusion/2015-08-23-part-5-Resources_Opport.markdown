For the second year, The Arc is working with the Corporation for National and Community Service to offer $10,000 grants to chapters of The Arc to develop service projects that celebrate Dr. King. These projects will bring together volunteers from and without disabilities to provide food assistance in their communities. The Arc will work with state and local chapters to:
<ul>
	<li>Partner with a service club to recruit volunteers with and without disabilities</li>
	<li>Work with hunger-focused groups (food banks, soup kitchens, etc) to deliver food aid</li>
	<li>Provide food aid on MLK Day and through the end of the grant (August 1, 2017)</li>
	<li>Raise $35,000 in in-kind or cash matching funds to support the project</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.thearc.org/file/2017-MLK-Day-of-Service-RFP.pdf">Proposals are due August 19</a>. Questions? Contact <a href="mailto:Sladen@thearc.org">Jennifer Sladen</a>.
