Find those donors by using Wealth Engine to help focus your attention on donors who have the wealth to give at higher levels. The Arc has a discounted price (33% off!) available for Wealth Engineâ€”but only if we get 25 chapters on board! To find out how Wealth Engine may be able to help you and your chapter save money (and make money) with their service, contact <a href="mailto:hayes@thearc.org">Sydney Hayes</a>. The deadline to sign on is October 31!
