We are proud to be the recipient of a Silver Telly Award for our public service announcement, The Arc Across a Lifetime. The PSA captures how The Arc is there with people with I/DD and their families throughout the arc of their lifetime â€“ from birth, to school, to young adulthood, through their journey to employment, and even into the twilight years.
