There are many options for where adults with I/DD could live. Some people with I/DD may live independently, with other family members after they leave their parents’ home, or in a community-based setting with support. It is important to balance the wishes of the person with I/DD and the level of support needed when identifying housing options available in your community. We will focus on how to explore housing options with an adult with I/DD. We will provide tips on important questions to ask the person with I/DD about where he or she wants to live when determining housing options. We will also provide guidance on how the family can work with the person with I/DD to determine supports needed to and housing preferences.
