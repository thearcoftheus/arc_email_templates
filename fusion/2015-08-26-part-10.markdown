<a href="www.SupportedDecisionMaking.org">The National Resource Center for Supported Decision-Making</a> is accepting applications for the second year of their State Grant Program. They will be awarding grants for state-based projects that adopt an innovative approach to increase knowledge of and access to Supported Decision-Making by older adults and people with I/DD across the life course. The application deadline is September 15, 2016. See more details in the <a href="#">full funding announcement here</a>. (link to PDF which I am sending separately).
