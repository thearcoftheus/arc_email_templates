Join us at the 6th annual M-Enabling Summit, the leading global conference and showcase on the East Coast dedicated to technological innovations that enable seniors and persons with disabilities to access digital content and services in new ways.
With its 2017 theme, “Making Connected Things and Services Accessible for All,” the M-Enabling Summit sets the stage to promote accessible products, services and assistive technologies. It also offers an ideal platform to network with accessibility professionals, organizations, and decision makers seeking to address compliance challenges and market development opportunities. 
In the spotlight: accessibility for better branding, consumer marketing, innovation in robotics, wearables, virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, IoT, smart homes, Section 508 and WCAG 2.1, as well as scaling-up accessibility in higher education, businesses, government, and smart cities. New to the M-Enabling Summit is the addition of the IAAP Pre Conference Session taking place June 12. <a href="http://www.m-enabling.com/conreg.html">Register today</a>.
